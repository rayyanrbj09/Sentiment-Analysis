# Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data Using Spark

## Project Overview

We aims to perform sentiment analysis on social media data collected from Twitter and Reddit. By leveraging Apache Spark for large-scale data processing, we extract insights into public sentiment on various topics using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Key Features

- **Real-time data collection** from Twitter and Reddit.
- **Large-scale data processing** using Apache Spark.
- **Sentiment classification** into Positive, Negative, and Neutral categories.
- **Storage of processed data** in a database for further analysis.
- **Data visualization** through an interactive dashboard.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Big Data Framework:** Apache Spark (PySpark)
- **Data Collection:** Twitter API (Tweepy), Reddit API (PRAW)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLTK, TextBlob, Vader, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Database:** MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Streamlit/Dash
- **Deployment:** AWS/GCP/Azure

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
    - Fetch live data from Twitter and Reddit using APIs.
    - Store raw data in a database.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
    - Clean text (remove URLs, special characters, stopwords, etc.).
    - Convert text to lowercase and tokenize it.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**
    - Use pre-trained sentiment analysis models (Vader, TextBlob, or BERT).
    - Train a custom ML model for better accuracy.

4. **Data Storage & Retrieval**
    - Store processed data in MongoDB or PostgreSQL.

5. **Visualization & Dashboard**
    - Create interactive charts and graphs to display sentiment trends.
    - Develop a web-based dashboard using Streamlit or Dash.

6. **Deployment**
    - Deploy API backend using Flask/Django/FastAPI.
    - Host the dashboard on a cloud platform.

## Dataset Sources

- Twitter Live Data (collected via Twitter API)
- Reddit Posts and Comments (collected via Reddit API)
- Sentiment140 Dataset (for model training)
- IMDB Reviews Dataset (for sentiment classification)

## Potential Use Cases

- Social media trend analysis
- Brand reputation monitoring
- Political sentiment tracking
- Customer feedback analysis

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a real-time streaming pipeline using Kafka.
- Improve sentiment classification with deep learning models.
- Deploy on a cloud-based Spark cluster for scalability.
- Expand to multiple social media platforms.

## Conclusion

We are tend to  demonstrate an end-to-end workflow for analyzing social media sentiment using big data tools. It is ideal as a capstone project for portfolios and can be used in real-world applications for sentiment monitoring and analytics.
